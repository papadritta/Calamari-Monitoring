>**Calamari Network is a private layer built for the entire Kusama ecosystem. Built on the substrate framework, Calamari Network is natively compatible with other projects and parachain assets including wrapped major cryptoassets.**
>**Calamari, Manta Network's canary net, is the plug-and-play privacy-preservation parachain built to serve the Kusama world.**
>**The Calamari parachain will be Privacy Hub for Kusama with multiple privacy solutions for all web3 projects.**

>**Many individuals joined the adventure and set up their own validator node, which is extraordinary for decentralization.
